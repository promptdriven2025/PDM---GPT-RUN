Although the rules for distinguishing moths from butterflies are not well established, one very good guiding principle is that butterflies have thin antennae and (with the exception of the family Hedylidae) have small balls or clubs at the end of their antennae. Moth antennae are usually feathery with no ball on the end. The divisions are named by this principle: ""club-antennae"" (Rhopalocera) or ""varied-antennae"" (Heterocera).

Historically, all worm-like animals were classified as Vermes, a term now outdated. Major groups of worms include flatworms (Platyhelminthes), segmented worms (Annelida), ribbon worms (Nemertea), and roundworms (Nematoda).
Worms vary greatly in size, from less than 1 mm in certain roundworms to over 30 m in ribbon worms. They are found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. Some are parasitic, while others are free-living. Ecologically, worms are vital as soil conditioners and integral parts of food chains. They can also be pests, parasitizing humans, animals, and crops.

In the society of dogs, the class system has historically been divided into pure breeds and mixed breeds.

However, the canine class system, much like human hierarchy, has been altered over time.

ROUND-05-194_194_0_T-XJJWBO,"Designer dog breeds are intentionally created by crossing two or more purebred dogs to combine the most desirable traits of each parent. Unlike mixed-breed dogs, designer dogs have a known ancestry, sometimes involving multiple pure breeds. The goal of this deliberate breeding is to enhance qualities such as appearance, temperament, and health. Popular examples of designer dog breeds include Cavachons, , Chugs, Cockapoos, and Goldadors. Other well known hybrids like Labradoodles, Puggles, and Pomskies also fall into this category. This selective breeding process ensures that the offspring inherit the best features from both parent breeds. Designer dogs are available in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and temperaments, appealing to a broad range of dog enthusiasts. It is important to research and choose responsible breeders to ensure the health and wellbeing of these hybrid dogs.
